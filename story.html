            <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is set in Night City, a dark futuristic city located in California. You play as V, an either male or female
            mercenary. Armed with powerful guns and high-tech cybernetic enhancements, V takes on high-risk, high-reward jobs to build his reputation in ultimate pursuit of a legendary cybernetic chip that grants its user immortality. V will have to fight off rival gangs, criminals, police, corporate executives, and anyone else that gets in their way in order to survive the unforgiving streets of Night City. Throughout the story, V is accompanied by a hologram of Johnny Silverhand, a supremely famous rockstar who's conciousness is stored on a chip inside V's head. The real Silverhand's whereabouts is unknown, though just like anyone else in Cyberpunk, Silverhand has his own motives and objectives that V can either follow or ignore, leaving the choice up to the player on whether Silverhand is V's friend or foe. Nobody in Cyberpunk can be trusted; everyone's loyalty is given to the highest bidder. There are no heros in Cyberpunk; only those that fight the hardest to survive. </p>
